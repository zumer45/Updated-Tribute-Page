        <h2>Key Points in the Life of Prophet Muhammad (صلى الله عليه وسلم)</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Born in 570 CE in Mecca, in present-day Saudi Arabia, Muhammad (صلى
            الله عليه وسلم) belonged to the Quraysh tribe.
          </li>
          <li>
            He was orphaned at a young age, as his father, Abdullah, died before
            he was born, and his mother, Aminah, passed away when he was six
            years old.
          </li>
          <li>
            His grandfather, Abdul Muttalib, and later his uncle, Abu Talib,
            took care of him after his parents' deaths.
          </li>
          <li>
            As a young man, Muhammad (صلى الله عليه وسلم) worked as a shepherd
            and later as a successful merchant, gaining the nickname "Al-Amin"
            (the Trustworthy).
          </li>
          <li>
            At the age of 25, he married Khadijah (RA), a wealthy widow who was
            15 years older than him. She was his first wife, and their marriage
            lasted until her death 25 years later.
          </li>
          <li>
            Muhammad (صلى الله عليه وسلم) would often retreat to the Cave of
            Hira for meditation and contemplation.
          </li>
          <li>
            At the age of 40, during one of his retreats in the Cave of Hira,
            Muhammad (صلى الله عليه وسلم) received his first revelation from
            Allah through the angel Gabriel. This marked the beginning of his
            prophethood.
          </li>
          <li>
            The revelations continued throughout his life and were compiled into
            the Quran, the Islamic holy book.
          </li>
          <li>
            In the early years of his prophethood, Muhammad (صلى الله عليه وسلم)
            faced opposition and persecution from the Meccan tribes,
            particularly the Quraysh, who saw his teachings as a threat to their
            social and religious order.
          </li>
          <li>
            In 622 CE, the Prophet Muhammad (صلى الله عليه وسلم) and his
            followers migrated from Mecca to Medina in a journey known as the
            Hijrah. This event marks the beginning of the Islamic calendar.
          </li>
          <li>
            In Medina, Muhammad (صلى الله عليه وسلم) established the first
            Islamic community (ummah) and formed alliances with various tribes,
            creating a unified political and religious entity.
          </li>
          <li>
            In 630 CE, after a series of battles and negotiations, the Prophet
            Muhammad (صلى الله عليه وسلم) and his followers peacefully entered
            and took control of Mecca, effectively uniting the Arabian Peninsula
            under Islam.
          </li>
          <li>
            The Prophet Muhammad's (صلى الله عليه وسلم) teachings emphasized the
            importance of faith, prayer, charity, fasting, and pilgrimage, which
            form the Five Pillars of Islam.
          </li>
          <li>
            The Prophet's life and sayings, known as Hadith, are considered a
            source of guidance and inspiration for Muslims worldwide, alongside
            the Quran.
          </li>
          <li>
            The Prophet Muhammad (صلى الله عليه وسلم) passed away in 632 CE in
            Medina, leaving behind a lasting legacy and a rapidly expanding
            Islamic community.
